# Notepad--

## A text editor with additional features developed in Rust

---

## **Project Background**

This application was developed as a **group project** during my software development studies, specifically for a course focused on the **Rust programming language**. Our team consisted of three developers. While my individual contribution was part of a collaborative effort, I'm proud to showcase this project as I believe it demonstrates strong teamwork and a successful implementation.

We chose **Dioxus**, a relatively new Rust framework that was in its beta phase at the time, for its promising capabilities in building **desktop applications**. Its potential to deliver a robust and efficient user experience aligned perfectly with our project goals.

### **Main Description**

Notepad-- is a **desktop text editor** designed to provide comprehensive text file handling and advanced features. The application supports basic file operations such as **opening folders** and **creating various file types**. Users can interact with the editor using both **mouse and keyboard controls**.

Key functionalities include customizable **undo/redo steps** (configurable in settings) and standard editor features like **keyboard shortcuts**. These shortcuts facilitate efficient navigation (e.g., arrow key movement, Ctrl + arrow key jumps), text selection (Shift + arrow keys), and common operations like **copy, paste, cut, undo, and redo**. Additionally, the editor includes a robust **find and replace** functionality.

# My School Project Showcase

Welcome to my School Project Showcase! Here, you'll discover a compilation of projects that reflect my academic journey, showcasing my interests, skills, and acquired knowledge. Among these projects, you'll find examples covering the basics of image processing, as well as projects implemented using C++ and the QT framework. Feel free to explore and draw inspiration from the work I've accomplished.

My latest and definitely my favourite addition is my new hobby project called TextInatorX. This project was meant as an excercise for me to learn more about microservices and kafka in a practical way.
